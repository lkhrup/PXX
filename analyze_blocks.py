Instructions:
From the input, extract the vote cast on TESLA, INC (ticker TSLA) issue/proposal number 1 at the 21-Mar-18 special meeting.
Issue 1 can be identified with one of these phrasings (or variations thereof):
- Approval of Performance Stock Option Agreement,
- Approve Grant of Performance-Based Stock Option Award,
- Approve Stock Option Grant to Elon Musk.
Consider only the issue mentioned, disregard any other issues in the input.
Consider only the actual vote, ignore the Management Recommendation (which is For on this issue).
For example, if you see "Mgt Rec Vote Cast" in the input, then "For Against" on the next line would mean Mgt Rec = For, Vote Cast = Against.
The text may be preformatted and keeping track of column alignments may help. Columns may be separated with the '|' character.
Your response must be "None" if the input does not include a definite vote on the relevant issue (Did Not Vote, incorrect meeting date, irrelevant security).
Otherwise, your response must be a single word, "For" or "Against".
For example "For 7:13" means "For" on line 7, column 13.
Do not explain your reasoning.
