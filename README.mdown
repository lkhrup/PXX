# ProXy vote eXtractor

## Install requirements

```sh
pip install requests lxml
```

## How To Use

```sh
python3 fetch_filings.py
python3 split_blocks.py
time OLLAMA_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:11434 python3 analyze_blocks.py
python3 export.py > export.csv
```

## Approach

Outline:

1. Fetch all filings from the SEC website, saving filing metatat in a database.
2. Split the filings (converted to plain text) into blocks mentioning the security of interest;
   for each block, we identify the fund by going backwards in the text until we find a fund name.
3. Analyze the blocks using an LLM (ollama server, llama3:70B),
   and inject votes into the database.
4. Export the results to a CSV file
